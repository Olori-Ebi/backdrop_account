The Levenshtein distance algorithm is generally simpler and faster than the Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm, as it only allows for the insertion, deletion, and substitution of characters. The Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm adds swapping of adjacent characters to this list, which makes it more complex and computationally expensive. In the context of comparing two strings (in our case, account name from the client payload and account name from paystack response) and determining their similarity, using Levenshtein distance algorithm can provide a more accurate and efficient solution.
